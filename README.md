# ENGI210-coral-chamber-2022

Our project targets the problem of coral bleaching. 
Problem Statement: In order to aid research into engineering thermotolerant coral polyps, our device provides a controlled environment to assess individual specimens of coral in a 24-hour cycle. This is achieved through a leakproof, illuminated, water-cycling, temperature-controlled chamber that can interface with a confocal microscope.
This page serves as a system overview for the electric components and the dimensions of the physical components.
